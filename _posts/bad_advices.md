Group 4: environment 
I can hardly understand why...
Why don’t you use Linux? Although the interface is ugly and fonts may crush, but all-in-all we are here to web-develop, not to design. I agree this statement to be a holywar start, so will pause right here. 

Why your programmers do not you set their dev-environment themselves? Yes, it will definitely take a couple of days for a newbie to do that, but this will no doubt make him closer to project understanding as well. And for a team-lead or PM this will uncover the real level of a developer they invite into their project. 

Why do you code with warning notification turn off? I vote for the early bug detection and cost cut for the excessive QA department. 

Why do you work without beta? I can not imagine zero-time-deployment and proper testing without beta at all. 

Why do you keep your production without any set integration test system? I do insist on running Jenkins and some sort of script once an hour to log in/ sign in/ check mail/ purchase/ sell and panic in case of any problem with a message to your mail/ hipchat or whichever you prefer. It will really save your money, nerve and client base. 

Why do you invest into site SEO, when it’s load time takes several seconds? This is useless and too expensive. 

Group 5: the team
I am pity to say, but there are issues without any possible (positive) solution. 
Networking issue
When you deal with investors, they will deny all your base normalization, CAP-theoremes and other IT treasures. They invest money, they want ROI level to grow faster. They may talk to you about terms and...money. 
The solution I would apply is to choose a pull of tasks, make the client understand the cost of implementation on an updated system will be LESS than task completion and system regular repair one. You may be far from a good networker. So, stay aside, as you may do more harm with uneven communication. In case you have succeeded, I recommend choosing the new/ fresh tasks from the list, the old ones will provoke reasonable questions “why now? what have you done all the time before?”
And yes, it’s better to build a proper and well-thought-out project at once. 
Management issue
Let’s agree, that any poor code was not created by itself. All of us recall the Miscosoft SEO Bill GAtes authoritarian management style. He used to loudly argue with his colleagues, shift the due dates to the absurd ones and many more, which resulted into a rapid sometimes idiotic architectural and/or technological decisions. And the users are the ones to suffer, alongside with the developers team. 
The axiom of the adepts of this management style sounds like “developers like re-writing. We will not do this.” 
I do not see a positive solution here rather than to dialogue. If there is no possibility to have an effective communication, you’ll better search for another project. 
The other side of the coin is specialist centralization. There are people who keep control over too many tasks and projects, so you have to wait for a simple solution/ resolution for ages. Bottleneck as it is. But it may be solved, if agreed, with microteams creation.
