Idealism in it is some kind of religion. It's a belief that we can make the digital world better - simpler, faster, more user-friendly, a bit more stable and secure, more comfort and beautiful. 

The way to obtain it is a very simple - you make your own projects better with every commit, with every implemented feature or class/service structure refactoring.

Because we kill everything good we have when e.g. making db servers to support unused indexes and make unindexed queries in the name of entropy. We do spend project owner's money, we do spend users's pathience, we do waste programmer's time and we do waste electrical power. What is that for?


Idealism in it is a way to happy wake up in the morning with thoughts "what can i do better today?". I'm not sure that God is done already. I'm going to think we're writing him right now. So let's make him as bugless as we can.
